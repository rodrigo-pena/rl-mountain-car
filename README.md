Reinforcement learning solution for a mountain-car problem

Goal: help an under-powered car find its way up a steep hill. Since the car has not enough power to directly climb the hill, the solution is to swing it back-and-forth, applying at each cycle the car's modest force in the right direction. *

Implementation: neural network with reward-modulated plasticity.

Developed as a mini-project for the course CS-434 "Unsupervised and Reinforcement Learning in Neural Networks", Fall 2016, EPFL.
